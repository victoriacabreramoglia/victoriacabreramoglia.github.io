# Introduction 

Howdy! This repository holds my (Victoria Cabrera-Moglia speaking) personal site. It's going to be a portfolio for all sorts of things, including my programming stuff and my writing stuff. To the extent practicable, this repository should always hold all the content you'd need to spin up this site on your own machine and start messing with it. 

## Who may find this useful? 

### Beginners

I'm a Working Developer (TM) with 1.5 years of professional experience as of May 2020. Mostly, I work on back-end/data-engineering type stuff, so this isn't going to be a masterclass in incredibly slick...well, anything. However, I am a qualitatively different programmer than I was when I graduate from the <a href="www.carolinacodeschool.com"> Carolina Code School</a>, and in working on this site I have seen that it is very different from the kind of HTML/CSS I was writing back in the day. It may thus be helpful to beginning programmers who are still developing their rudimentary code instincts ("this is an elegant solution to this problem"/"should I actually even be solving this problem, or is this a bad design choice?"/"Oh, God, this would be a nightmare to maintain").

### Old hands who haven't done front-end in a while

Devs who got their chops back when vanilla CSS wasn't enough for site layout/responsive design may find this repo to be a pleasant surprise. For as long as I can, I am going to keep libraries out of this code. Instead, I will be investing heavily in learning modern CSS tooling. Specifically, check out the layout of the welcome screen: that's a responsive grid done entirely in vanilla HTML/CSS, and the mobile view has a carousel achieved using only CSS's flexbox features. I think minimizing reliance on libraries is good, and while they remain essential in a production environment I think they are mental crutches that tend to make us less resourceful, not more. In this cloistered codebase, I get to indulge this vendetta, and you may find it a breathe of fresh air. Or not, if the code is bad. :-) (I am always open to PRs!) 

### "Humanities people"

The scare quotes are friendly! The humanities were my first love, and on most days I'd still rather be writing poetry than code <a href="https://google.com/search?&q=ruby+is+the+greatest">(unless I'm writing Ruby, which is always poetry by definition)</a>. In an ideal world, I would be teaching Borges to impressionable yound minds and puffing on a clay pipe, blissfully unaware of the concept of computing. Unfortunately, we don't live in that world, and <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">the world we do live in is rapidly computerizing.</a> 

But, my dear "humanities people," I am pretty sure that you do not, in fact, exist. Check this out!

					We tell ourselves stories in order to live. The princess is trapped in the consulate. The man with the candy will lead the children into the sea...We interpret what see, select the most workable of the multiple choices. We live entirely, especially if we are writers, by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the 'ideas' with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria which is our actual experience."

That isn't real code, but it's pretty close. I think that with some effort you could probably understand the paradigm there and extend it pretty quickly. 

I'm not saying coding is easy! It is incredibly hard and frustrating, especially at first. But it's eminently workable, and more intuitive than we have been led to believe by the priestly elite of our technological age. In fact coding is super simple, and knowing to code doesn't mean that you're smart. It just means you've learned to code. Not knowing how to code doesn't mean you're not smart. It just means you haven't yet learned to code. And being a humanities person means you are an excellent learner. Give it a go!

Specifically, give HTML and CSS a go! You'll be surprised at how far they can take you. If you are crafting a personal site, such as this one, they are really all you need to get started. They are all I used to make a home page of which I am pretty damn proud. 

For me, a well-crafted, beautiful personal site is more of a document than it is any kind of application. It doesn't need to be more than that to good at what it needs to do: tell a story about who I am, what I have done, and what I like. You are someone, you have done things, and there are things you like. If you want a beautiful place on the Internet to tell people about that cheaply and simply, it is within your reach. And I am always available to help (on a when-I-can basis): <a href="victoria.cabrera.dev@gmail.com"> email me! </a>
